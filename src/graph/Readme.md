## Assumptions

that 2 menu 2 the user does not want to see the relationship of the original user linking back to themselves eg Hulk knows Hulk

that it should be case sensitive for eg we dont want batman and Batman in the graph

## Things to fix

the file validation logic is not right because if the graph is intastaited with the wrng number of nodes then it fails

in the menu's if you type a string instead of int it throws an error

using coretto had to use map.entry instead of just Entry check if this is ok


Questions

how do i implement the delete node
should searching be case sensitive
