## Assumptions

that 2 menu 2 the user does not want to see the relationship of the original user linking back to themselves eg Hulk knows Hulk

that it should be case insensitive for search 

## Things to fix

the file validation logic is not right because if the graph is intastaited with the wrng number of nodes then it fails

remove null from the searches when we set a node to null
eg the null shouldnt appear in the popular list

searching case sensitive



## Questions

using coretto had to use map.entry instead of just Entry check if this is ok
